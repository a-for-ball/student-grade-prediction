## Absract
Artificial intelligence (AI), in the rapidly developing field of technology, is becoming an essential component of our everyday existence. In order to enhance quality of life, machine learning algorithms are frequently used to forecast any kind of phenomenon that can be expressed in mathematical words and equations. This project aims to empower teachers to intervene when a student is not performing well in a particular subject, so introducing a quality of life shift in the traditional model of conventional teaching approaches. An instructor can detect and take action to guarantee that every student in their care succeeds well in the subject by entering a variety of academic and environmental elements. If given the opportunity to see their own projected performance, students can also gain from this kind of approach since it helps them focus their time and resources appropriately to fully comprehend the material.

## Future work
In order to fulfil the aims of providing educators and students with a proper tool for any given platform, an interface is planned to be created. This interface will be provided in a web based application, making seamless integration possible for anyone wishing to implement this study's findings on their own.
