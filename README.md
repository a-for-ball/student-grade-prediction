In the fast evolving world of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
very integral part of our daily lives. Using machine learning algorithms is a
common practice to predict any sort of phenomenon which can be encapsulated in
mathematical terms and equations, in order to improve quality of life. This project
aims to introduce a quality of life shift in the paradigm of conventional teaching
methods by empowering educators to step in when a student is prone to not
perform well in any particular subject. By inputting various environmental and
academic factors, an educator can identify and then take steps to ensure that each
and every student under their care performs well in the subject. Students can also
benefit from such a process, if allowed to view their own predicted performance,
they can direct their time and resources in the right direction in order to understand
the subject of concern.
